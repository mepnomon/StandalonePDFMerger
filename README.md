# StandalonePDFMerger
A standalone PDF Merging Tool.

This is still a work in progress. Basic functionality has been implemented and a preliminary GUI can be used.

The executable JAR WITH DEPENDENCIES can be found in ../target. 
Double click on the DocumentMerger snapshot to execute.
The software has not been tested, so no warranties are made.
Use at your own peril. If you'd like to give some feedback as to errors you encountered/improvements of the look and feel
shoot me a message.
